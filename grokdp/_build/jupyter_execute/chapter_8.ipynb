    "# Chapter 8: Dynamic Programming in Arrays and Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming (DP) is particularly useful for solving problems involving arrays and matrices. In this chapter, we'll explore two classic problems: Matrix Chain Multiplication and Maximal Square.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.1 Matrix Chain Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together. The problem is not to actually perform the multiplications, but merely to decide in which order to perform the multiplications.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have three matrices A, B, and C with dimensions 10x30, 30x5, and 5x60 respectively. There are two ways to multiply them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (AB)C = (10x30x5) + (10x5x60) = 1500 + 3000 = 4500 operations\n",
    "2. A(BC) = (30x5x60) + (10x30x60) = 9000 + 18000 = 27000 operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the first way is more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve this problem using a 2D DP table. Let $dp[i][j]$ represent the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to compute the matrix product from the $i$-th matrix to the $j$-th matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recurrence relation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$dp[i][j] = \\min_{k=i}^{j-1} (dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + d[i-1] * d[k] * d[j])$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d[i-1]$, $d[k]$, and $d[j]$ are the dimensions of the matrices.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming in arrays and matrices often involves 2D DP tables and can solve complex optimization problems efficiently. The key is to define the right recurrence relation and build the DP table step by step.\n",
