    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate how Dynamic Programming is applied across diverse fields to solve complex real-world problems. From analyzing genetic sequences in bioinformatics to pricing financial instruments, from decoding speech to planning robot paths, DP proves to be a versatile and powerful technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, the core principles of DP—breaking down problems into smaller subproblems and storing intermediate results—remain consistent across these applications. However, each domain requires careful problem formulation and often combines DP with domain-specific knowledge and heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we'll explore common patterns and problem-solving strategies in DP, which will help you recognize and solve DP problems across various domains."
