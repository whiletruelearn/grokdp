    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate how Dynamic Programming is applied across diverse fields to solve complex real-world problems. From analyzing genetic sequences in bioinformatics to pricing financial instruments, from decoding speech to planning robot paths, DP proves to be a versatile and powerful technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, the core principles of DPâ€”breaking down problems into smaller subproblems and storing intermediate resultsâ€”remain consistent across these applications. However, each domain requires careful problem formulation and often combines DP with domain-specific knowledge and heuristics.\n",

    "In the next chapter, we'll explore common patterns and problem-solving strategies in DP, which will help you recognize and solve DP problems across various domains."
