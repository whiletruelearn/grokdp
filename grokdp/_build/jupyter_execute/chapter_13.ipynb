    "## Problem 1: House Robber\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic DP problem. We can define our DP state as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`dp[i]` = the maximum amount of money we can rob from the first i houses\n",
    "\n",
    "The recurrence relation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])`\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that for each house, we have two options:\n",
    "1. Don't rob this house: `dp[i-1]`\n",
    "2. Rob this house: `dp[i-2] + nums[i]` (we add the current house value to the max we could rob from two houses ago)\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the maximum of these two options.\n",
